# Project 1, Milestone 3 Feedback

NetID: [Student's NetID]

Milestone 3 is graded for a **completion grade _by section_**. This is a feedback milestone. If you tried to complete it, even though there are some mistakes, you'll get full credit **for that section**. If a section is obviously incomplete, you'll get a 0. **There is no partial credit within a specific section.**

We provide feedback on your milestones to help guide your work for the final submission. Our feedback is designed to help you learn more; our feedback is not a "_pre-grade_". This feedback is designed to catch large problems (which we sometimes miss). **Regardless of the feedback (or lack of feedback) that you get, you are responsible for meeting all of the project's requirements for the final submission.**

_For Milestone 3, you'll create two distinctly visually styled version of the site. (i.e., not just different colors)._

## Grader Instructions

- **Specify the reason for any points deducted!**
- A student must demonstrate a **good-faith effort to receive full credit** for a specific section.

    Mistakes are okay. **This is about feedback.**

    It's possible to not check any boxes in a section and still issue full credit for that section (again, good-faith effort, even if incorrect).
